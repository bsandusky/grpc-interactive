# rGRPC Interactive
## This project is a work in progress

Welcome to gRPC Interactive, a tutorial intended to teach you about gRPC, an open source implementation of Remote Procedure Call. The tutorial itself goes into more detail to explain what gRPC is and how to build applications which take advantage of the gRPC and Protocol Buffers frameworks.

If you're interested in building microservices and APIs, this tutorial will be of interest to you. We assume you have basic programming knowledge, including at least one modern programming language, preferable Go, as this tutorial uses Go extensively throughout. We also assume you have written at least one REST API, are familiar with tooling for distributed computing, like AWS Lambda and Docker, as well as have your own working development environment already set up.

To get started with this tutorial, execute a GET request using the client of your choice to `www.TKTK.com` for Step 001 instructions.
